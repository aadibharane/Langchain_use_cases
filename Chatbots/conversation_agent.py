#Conversation Agent
'''
This notebook walks through using an agent optimized for conversation. Other agents are often optimized for using 
tools to figure out the best response, which is not ideal in a conversational setting where you may want the agent 
to be able to chat with the user as well.
This is accomplished with a specific type of agent (conversational-react-description) which expects to be used with a memory component.
